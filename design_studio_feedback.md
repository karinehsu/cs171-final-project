The feedback we received from Kat and Patrick were extremely helpful. 

First, we showed them our bar graph comparing different currency trade volumes. They were surprised that Litecoin was the highest traded currency, even over Bitcoin's trading volume but thought that our barchart accurately displayed the data even though some of the bars didn't show up for the top 10 chart. They liked the hover tooltip that displayed additional information as well. They also thought that our second and third smaller visualizations, where we show a quick reference table that included the top 10 and also a description of the specific currency the hover over, was very helpful as well. 

As we explained the other visualizations and what are data consisted of, they suggested other visualizations that we could show and questions that they would like answered about digital currencies. One visualization they suggested was geomapping real-time transaction data from blockchain onto a map of the world based on IP addresses. Another visualization was adding in data of any recent events/news via twitter (#bitcoin) that might predict changes in bitcoin prices. This specific piece of feedback was useful, but we eventually thought it'd be too difficult to only select the most relevant mentions of Bitcoin on Twitter as a predicting factor for prices. Some other questions they suggested we could answer with the data include which days of the week or any periods of time have higher trading volumes.

After this feedback, we decided to implement the geomapping data onto a map of the globe.
