        This interactive visualization allows the exploration of the increasing popularity and usage of Bitcoin and its trends relating to other digital currencies, trading volume, and price, since 2011. We explore how various events affect prices, such as the announcement of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy protection or how large vs small transaction sizes affect prices on a per day basis. We use bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots to visually represent these interesting insights.


        Questions we tried to answer: 
        <li>How are price and volume of Bitcoin correlated, if at all? Does it follow typical higher price, higher volume rules? </li>
        <li>    How does Bitcoin trading volumes compare to other digital currencies? </li>
        <li>    How does news about Bitcoin affect price changes in Bitcoin? </li>
<li>How are various components of Bitcoin related? Total bitcoins in circulation vs. market cap? Number of transactions vs. difficulty? </li>
         <li>   On a specific day, how are prices affected when a large number of people exchange small amounts of Bitcoin or when a small number of people exchange large amounts? </li>
 

 <br><b>Conclusions: </b>

<p>In summary, we learned several things from our visualizations. 

<br>1. Litecoin is traded in higher volume than Bitcoin.  <br>
Answers the question: How does Bitcoin trading volumes compare to other digital currencies? We actually used the top 10 bar chart to determine which were the “important” currencies to download historical price data for and compare Bitcoin to.<br>
<br>2. Price and volume are positively correlated. 
Answers the question: How are price and volume of Bitcoin correlated, if at all? Does it follow typical higher price, higher volume rules? By using brushing and linking with our price and volume charts, we saw that general upward trends in price are linked with positive trends in volume, and that negative trends in price are linked with negative trends in volume. <br><br>
3. The number of unique Bitcoin transactions is not directly correlated with average value of Bitcoin, but the number of unique Bitcoin transactions minus the number of top 100 traders is directly correlated with the average value. This tells us that the top 100 traders aren’t people who are actively investing in the market, just people who use it as a digital currency. 
Answers the question: How are various components of Bitcoin related? We used our overlay graphs to come to this conclusion. <br><br>
4. Not all major events affect Bitcoin prices, but if a well-known company invests in Bitcoin or if there is a major crash, there will be a large effect on price. 
Answers the question: How does the news affect Bitcoin prices? Going through our events, we notice that when there is a big news event such that Bitcoin reaches an all-time high, like in 2/22/2013, Bitcoin reaches $30 USD, people stop buying and volume decreases significantly, even though we would typically expect people to buy more. Additionally, in 4/10/13, when there was a Bitcoin bubble, volume dropped by 300% over the course of a week. <br><br>
5. Bitcoin prices change at a fast pace. 
Answers the question: How do prices of Bitcoin compare to price of other digital currencies? We used our time lapse diagram to come to the conclusion that Bitcoin prices change at a much faster pace. </p>
